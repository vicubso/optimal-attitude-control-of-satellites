@article{Li2013,
abstract = {We present a satellite attitude control system design using low-cost hardware and software for a 1U CubeSat. The attitude control system architecture is a crucial subsystem for any satellite mission since precise pointing is often required to meet mission objectives. The accuracy and precision requirements are even more challenging for small satellites where limited volume, mass, and power are available for the attitude control system hardware. In this proposed embedded attitude control system design for a 1U CubeSat, pointing is obtained through a two-stage approach involving coarse and fine control modes. Fine control is achieved through the use of three reaction wheels or three magnetorquers and one reaction wheel along the pitch axis. Significant design work has been conducted to realize the proposed architecture. In this paper, we present an overview of the embedded attitude control system design; the verification results from numerical simulation studies to demonstrate the performance of a CubeSat-class nanosatellite; and a series of air-bearing verification tests on nanosatellite attitude control system hardware that compares the performance of the proposed nonlinear controller with a proportional-integral-derivative controller.},

@book{Pedregal2010,
abstract = {This is a basic text on the mathematical theory for optimal control problems in the sense that it addresses the most basic and pertinent questions in this field of applied mathematics. The main novelty in the text is the perspective to deal with those in a special way, as we systematically pursue the strategy of taking back any given optimal control situation to an equivalent variational problem. The title makes an attempt to convey this driving idea. In this way, basic results of existence of optimal solutions, optimality, and even approximation are examined from this standpoint. There are however a bunch of important and profound topics which are not deliberately treated here, as we regard them well beyond the scope of this text. These include, but are not limited to: • controllability; • observability; • singular controls; • state constraints; • non-existence; • incomplete information; • stochastic optimal control; • techniques for optimal control in realistic situations. The book can serve for a first course in optimal control within the context of a master program in applied mathematics or engineering; and it can also be helpful to more advanced students who would like to learn what the variational method, for optimal control, is about. It can also be useful for a second part of a course in variational principles. Prerequisites include, in addition to Linear Algebra, Multivariate Calculus, and Differential Equations, basic Measure Theory (results like the Lebesque differentia- tion theorem or the Riesz representation theorem will be invoked without a proof), and Functional Analysis including basic material on Sobolev spaces (results like the Brower fixed point theorem will also be used without a proof). A number of explicit examples have been described to motivate the subject, and to provide a set of test cases to check on the numerical approximation},

abstract = {This paper examines the performance of the pseudospectral optimal control scheme for closed-loop time-optimal attitude maneuvering of the NPSATI spacecraft, a magnetically actuated spacecraft designed and built at the Naval Postgraduate School. The closed-loop control is devised and implemented using the notion of Caratheodory-1T solutions: repeated computation and update of the complete open-loop control solution in real-time. The performance of the pseudospectral feedback-control scheme is compared to a standard state feedback-control technique. It is shown that the use of standard state feedback control leads to significantly slower convergence time and may lead to substantially lower performance metrics. The substantial performance gains when using closed-loop optimal control are attributed to the optimal scheme's ability to exploit the full maneuverability envelope of the spacecraft by applying bang-bang controls in all three directions. In contrast, traditional gain-based feedback control laws substantially limit the performance of the vehicle to well below its physical capabilities. The feasibility of each open-loop optimal control solution is verified by numerical propagation while Pontryagin's necessary conditions for optimality are used to verify the solution's optimality.},

I have radically modified much of the notation (to be consistent with my other writings), updated the references, added several new examples, and provided a proof of the PontryaginMaximumPrinciple. As this is a course for undergraduates, I have dispensed in certain proofs with various measurability and continuity issues, and as compensation have added various critiques as to the lack of total rigor.

The dynamics of the satellite are analytically studied on the whole control loop. The control loop is as follows: preliminary reorientation along with nutation damping, spinning about the axis of symmetry, then precise reorientation of the axis of symmetry in inertial space. Reorientation starts right after separation from the launch vehicle. Active magnetic attitude control system time-response with respect to its parameters is analyzed. It is proven that low-inclined orbit forces low control system time-response. Comparison with the common control scheme shows the time-response gain.

Each identical spacecraft carries a suite of ionospheric space weather payloads. The use of two identical CubeSats, at slightly different orbiting velocities in nearly identical orbits, permits the deconvolution of spatial and temporal ambiguities in the observations of the ionosphere from a moving platform. Deployable wire booms require each CubeSat to be spin stabilized. At-titude determination and control are accomplished using magnetometers, a sun sensor, and torque coils. Position and time are provided by GPS. DICE has greatly advanced nano-satellite based mission capabilities, demonstrat-ing constellation science and opening up a number of groundbreaking technolo-gies to the CubeSat community. DICE has made many co-incident observations of ionospheric structure and is the first CubeSat mission to observe field-aligned currents in the ionosphere. In this paper we will review the on-orbit performance ofthe DICE ADCS design as well as communications/GPS antenna issues asso-ciated with a spinning CubeSat.},

the 60th anniversary of B. Bonnard, held in Dijon in June 2012.
We focus on a controlled Cucker-Smale model in finite dimension. Such
dynamics model self-organization and consensus emergence in a group of
agents. We explore how it is possible to control this model in order to
enforce or facilitate pattern formation or convergence to consensus. In
particular, we are interested in designing control strategies that are
componentwise sparse in the sense that they require a small amount of
external intervention, and also time sparse in the sense that such
strategies are not chattering in time. These sparsity features are
desirable in view of practical issues.
We first show how very simple sparse feedback strategies can be designed
with the use of a variational principle, in order to steer the system to
consensus. These feedbacks are moreover optimal in terms of decay rate
of some functional, illustrating the general principle according to
which ``sparse is better{\{}''{\}}. We then combine these results with local
controllability properties to get global controllability results.
Finally, we explore the sparsity properties of the optimal control
minimizing a combination of the distance from consensus and of a norm of
the control.},

The proposed controller has two key features: It guarantees a uniformly bounded number of switches over any compact time interval, and it is robust against bounded measurement errors. When disturbances are absent, through a proper choice of the control parameters it reduces to the time-optimal bang-bang controller for the double-integrator.},

abstract = {We present a general approach to prove existence of solutions for optimal control problems not based on typical convexity conditions which quite often are very hard, if not impossible, to check. By taking advantage of several relaxations of the problem, we isolate an assumption which guarantees the existence of solutions of the original optimal control problem. To show the validity of this crucial hypothesis through various means and in various contexts is the main body of this contribution. In each such situation, we end up with some existence result. In particular, we would like to stress a general result that takes advantage of the particular structure of both the cost functional and the state equation. One main motivation for our work here comes from a model for guidance and control of ocean vehicles. Some explicit existence results and comparison examples are given.},

@phdthesis{Wisniewski1996,
abstract = {The primary purpose of this work was to develop control laws for three axis stabilization of a magnetic actuated satellite. This was achieved by a combination of linear and non- linear system theory. In order to reach this goal new theoretical results were produced in both ﬁelds. The focus of the work was on the class of periodic systems reﬂecting orbital motion of the satellite. In addition to a theoretical treatment, the thesis contains a large portion of application considerations. The controllers developed were implemented for the Danish Orsted satellite. The control concept considered was that interaction between the Earth's magnetic ﬁeld and a magnetic ﬁeld generated by a set of coils in the satellite can be used for actuation. Magnetic torquing was found attractive for generation of control torques on small satellites, since magnetic control systems are relatively lightweight, require low power and are inexpensive. However, this principle is inherently nonlinear and difﬁcult to use, because control torques can only be generated perpendicular to the geomagnetic ﬁeld vector. So far, this has prevented control in all three axes using magnetorquers only. A fact that the geomagnetic ﬁeld changed periodically when a satellite is on a near po- lar low Earth orbit was used throughout this thesis. Conﬁned computer capacity and a limit on electrical power supply were separate obstacles. They demanded computational simplicity and power optimality from the attitude control system. The design of quasi optimal controllers for a real-time implementation was a subject of considerations in the part on linear control methods for a satellite with a gravity gradient boom. Both time varying and constant gain controllers were developed and their performance was tested via simulation. The nonlinear controller for a satellite without appendages was given in the second part of the thesis. Its design was based on sliding mode control theory. The essence of the sliding control presented in the thesis was to split the controller design into two steps: a sliding manifold design and a sliding condition design. The emphasis was on the sliding condition design, which was stated as a continuous function of the state. A control law for magnetic actuated satellite was proposed. Complete comprehension of the nature of the satellite control problem required a new ap- viiproach merging the nonlinear control theory with physics of the rigid body motion and an extension of earlier results in this ﬁeld using the theory of periodic systems. The Lya- punov stability theory was employed based on the potential and kinetic energy of the rigid satellite. A velocity controller, that contributes to dissipation of both kinetic and potential energy, was proposed. The velocity control was shown to provide four stable equilibria, one of which was the desired orientation. It was explained how the equilibria depended on the ratio of the satellite's moments of inertia. It was further investigated how to control the attitude, such that the satellite was globally asymptotically stable in the desired orientation, avoiding the undesired equilibria. The main contribution of this work was to show that three axis control can be achieved with magnetorquers as sole actuators in a low Earth orbit. A rigorous stability analysis was presented, and detailed simulation results showed convincing performance over the entire envelope of operation of the Danish {\O}rsted satellite. The key results have also been published in international papers},

abstract = {The simple form of loopshaping in scalar systems does not extend directly to multivariable (MIMO) plants, which are characterized by transfer matrices instead of transfer functions. The notion of optimality is closely tied to MIMO control system design. Optimal controllers, i.e., controllers that are the best possible, according to some figure of merit, turn out to generate only stabilizing controllers for MIMO plants. In this sense, optimal control solutions provide an automated design procedure – we have only to decide what figure of merit to use. The linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is a well-known design technique that provides practical feedback gains. For the derivation of the linear quadratic regulator, we assume the plant to be written in state-space form ˙ x = Ax + Bu, and that all of the n states x are available for the controller. The feedback gain is a matrix K, implemented as u = −K(x−x desired). The system dynamics are then written as: x ˙ = (A − BK)x + BKx desired . (210)},

abstract = {Kidney transplantation is currently the treatment of choice for end-stage renal disease. Although new immunosuppressive drugs have been introduced into clinical practice, the effect of such medication on quality of life (QoL) in transplant recipients is still unclear. The present study analyzes the impact of tacrolimus-based immunosuppression on QoL in a representative sample of adult kidney transplant recipients from Rio Grande do Sul, a Brazilian southern state. This was a cross-sectional multicenter study which used the SF-36 Health Survey for measuring QoL. The effect of tacrolimus on QoL was adjusted for possible confounders using multiple linear regression. A total of 272 patients (from 11 different centers) were evaluated, 48 of them were treated with tacrolimus. Transplant patients in use of tacrolimus presented significant higher scores in the physical component summary of SF-36 than non-users (49.1+/-8.3 vs. 46.1+/-8.7; p=0.03), and such difference was noted in the physical functioning and general health subscales (81.5+/-17.1 and 74.7+/-21.8; 74.6+/-22.3 and 67.1+/-22.3 for users and non-users of tacrolimus, respectively, p{\textless}0.05). The effect of tacrolimus remained significant after adjustment for age, gender, skin color and time since transplantation (coeff.: 2.83; 95{\%} CI: 0.05-5.6, p=0.045). The association between tacrolimus-based immunosuppression and better perception of physical functioning and general health for renal transplant patients represents a significant finding as it may influence therapeutical decisions and contribute to maximize kidney transplantation benefits.},

First an appropriate actuator configuration, must be found and implemented. This includes interface circuitry, and a micro processor which can handle the control algorithms. Two controllers must be design, one to detumble the satellite after separation from the launch vehicle, and one which can stabilise the satellite at a give ref- erence. To accomplish this, a mathematical model of the system is derived. For detumbling a B-dot controller is derived, tested and implemented. For normal op- eration two controllers will be derived and tested. First a constant gain controller based on periodic op- timal control is setup. Then a controller based on LMI is derived. Both controllers are tested for both nadir and inertial pointing stability. The costant gain controller is found to have the best overall perfor- mance and is therefore implemented.},

abstract = {Nano-satellites provide space access to broader range of satellite developers and attract interests as an application of the space developments. These days several new nano-satellite missions are proposed with sophisticated objectives such as remote-sensing and observation of astronomical objects. In these advanced missions, some nano-satellites must meet strict attitude requirements for obtaining scientific data or images. For LEO nano-satellite, a magnetic attitude disturbance dominates over other environmental disturbances as a result of small moment of inertia, and this effect should be cancelled for a precise attitude control. This research focuses on how to cancel the magnetic disturbance in orbit. This paper presents a unique method to estimate and compensate the residual magnetic moment, which interacts with the geomagnetic field and causes the magnetic disturbance. An extended Kalman filter is used to estimate the magnetic disturbance. For more practical considerations of the magnetic disturbance compensation, this method has been examined in the PRISM (Pico-satellite for Remote-sensing and Innovative Space Missions). This method will be also used for a nano-astrometry satellite mission. This paper concludes that use of the magnetic disturbance estimation and compensation are useful for nano-satellites missions which require a high accurate attitude control. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This article presents an application of Model Predictive Controller (MPC) to the attitude control of a geostationary flexible satellite. SIMO model has been used for the geostationary satellite, using the Lagrange equations. Flexibility is also included in the modeling equations. The state space equations are expressed in order to simplify the controller. Naturally there is no specific tuning rule to find the best parameters of an MPC controller which fits the desired controller. Being an intelligence method for optimizing problem, Genetic Algorithm has been used for optimizing the performance of MPC controller by tuning the controller parameter due to minimum rise time, settling time, overshoot of the target point of the flexible structure and its mode shape amplitudes to make large attitude maneuvers possible. The model included geosynchronous orbit environment and geostationary satellite parameters. The simulation results of the flexible satellite with attitude maneuver shows the efficiency of proposed optimization method in comparison with LQR optimal controller.},

Some of the stability results are formulated based on Gronwall's lemma for global exponential stability, and they are either dependent on or independent of the delay size but they depend on the switching law through the requirement of a minimum residence time. Another set of results concerned with the weaker property of global asymptotic stability is also obtained as being independent of the switching law, but still either dependent on or independent of the delay size, since they are based on the existence of a common Krasovsky-Lyapunov functional for all the above-mentioned configurations. Extensions to a class of polytopic systems and to a class of regular time-varying systems are also discussed.},

The variation of t,he geomagnetic field along the orbit makes the dynamical equations time varying in nature. Hence we first present sufficient conditions for accessibil-ity, strong accessibility and controllability of a general time-varying system. We apply these sufficient condi-tions to show that the attitude dynamics of a spacecraft actuated by three magnetic actuators and subjected to a general time-varying magnetic field are strongly accessi-ble if the magnetic field and its first two time derivatives are linearly independent at every instant. In addition, if the magnetic field is periodic in time, then the attitude dynamics of the spacecraft are controllable. These results are used to show that the attitude dynamics of a space-craft actuated by three magnetic actuators in a closed Keplerian orbit in a nonrotating dipole approximation of the geomagnetic field are strongly accessible and control-lable if the orbital plane contains neither the geomagnetic equator nor the geomagnetic poles.},

The modal state-space approach is used to represent the dynamic behavior of the system. The final time and the residual vibrations are minimized with symmetric multi-switch bang-bang control, using only the lower vibratory modes of the distributed system, in a control model with finite dimensions. The performance of the multi-switch bang-bang control is compared with that of minimum-time single-switch bang-bang control. In the experiments a 60{\%} reduction in the residual vibrations of a flexible arm is achieved by multi-switch bang-bang control. The practical limitations of such an implementation resulting from the actuator and the effects of control spillover on the system are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

We start with some brief but complete discussions on the theory of quaternion which will be sufficient for the discussion in the remaining part of the review. We review the progress of quaternion based attitude determination which has been well recognized and achieved great success by using Newton's method. We also present a different and more elegant treatment on an analytic solution to Wahba's problem. For quaternion based control system design, we focus on some recently developed reduced quaternion models which use only vector component of the quaternion in the state space models. We discuss some new design method that has the following features: (a) it has an analytic solution of LQR, and (b) the designed system reduces disturbance effect, global stabilizes the nonlinear spacecraft system, and is robust to the modeling uncertainty. The presentation of the review is self-complete. It includes all the background information that is needed to understand the development involving the system modeling, the attitude determination, and the attitude control system design methods.},

abstract = {A three-axis closed-loop attitude-control system for earth-observatory momentum-bias spacecraft is proposed. A horizon scanner and magnetometer are employed to measure attitude errors; no yaw sensor is required. Appropriate control signals are generated and used to command variable-strength electromagnets, which interact with the geomagnetic field to reduce observed errors. This system provides for initial acquisition, precession control, nutation damping, and pitch-axis momentum control. All functions are performed autonomously - no ground-station interaction is required. Analytical expressions predicting system response are compared with numerical solutions of the governing equations, and with the results of the application of Floquet Theory.-},

abstract = {This paper discusses the design and simulation of LightSail-1's attitude determination and control system. LightSail-1 will launch in 2011 and deploy a 32 m2 mylar sail from a 3U CubeSat with the intent of measuring thrust from solar pressure and raising the orbit. The spacecraft will be actively controlled with magnetorquers and a momentum wheel. The various control modes throughout the short mission lifetime include detumble, sun-pointing, and orbit raising. Each one of these modes is simulated in MatLab, and the assumptions and limitations of the MatLab model are discussed. The simulations show that the spacecraft will detumble in 90 minutes after ejection from the P-POD and demonstrate successful sun-pointing within two orbit periods. Orbit raising will require two rapid 90° slew maneuvers every orbit which are accomplished with the momentum wheel.},

abstract = {The angular motion of an axisymmetrical satellite equipped with an active magnetic attitude control system is considered. The dynamics of the satellite are analytically studied on the whole control loop. The control loop is as follows: preliminary reorientation along with nutation damping, spinning about the axis of symmetry, then precise reorientation of the axis of symmetry in inertial space. Reorientation starts right after separation from the launch vehicle. Active magnetic attitude control system time-response with respect to its parameters is analyzed. It is proven that low-inclined orbit forces low control system time-response. Comparison with the common control scheme shows the time-response gain. Numerical analysis of the disturbances effect is carried out and good pointing accuracy is proved. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Temporelli2017,
abstract = {Vehicle's powertrain performance and comfort are largely depending on the clutch control strategy for an Automated Manual Transmission (AMT). The aim of the clutch control strategy is to ensure the smooth running of clutch operational cases: a comfortable clutch launch (vehicle takes off smoothly without jerk), a fast upshift/downshift (gear ratio changes) and a fast clutch opening. In most industrial cases, regardless of clutch actuation technology, clutch control is managed by clutch pressure control. However, the clutch pressure control is a challenge regarding clutch non-linearities and time-varying parameters. In this paper, a parallel adaptive feedforward and bang-bang controller is proposed in order to control the clutch pressure with an electromechanical clutch actuator. In this system, a control issue comes from potential time-varying parameters but the main challenge comes from the hysteretic behavior of the system due to dry friction in the actuator assembly. An analytic model of the clutch and its electromechanical actuator including dry friction has been constructed and a prototype has been designed and integrated on a test bench. The parallel adaptive feedforward and bang-bang controller architecture and algorithms are developed. For three critical clutch operational cases, simulations and experiments have been run. Finally, in spite of time-varying parameters and a high hysteretic system behavior, simulation and experimental control results highlight that the controller allows a precise tracking of the pressure reference and a fast time response.},

However, 3-axis magnetic actuation has only been proven to allow periodic controllability, not time-instantaneous controllability.

In the paper, conditions for the complete controllability for the case of a magnetically controlled satellite with passive air drag panels are developed, and simulation case studies with the LQR and MPC control designs applied in combination with a nonlinear time-varying input transformation are presented to demonstrate the ability of the closed-loop system to satisfy mission objectives despite disturbance torques.},

The actuation principle is to use the interaction between the earth's magnetic field and a magnetic field generated by a coil set in the satellite. This control principle is inherently time-varying, and difficult to use because control torques can only be generated perpendicular to the local geomagnetic field vector. This has been a serious obstacle for using magnetorquer based control for three-axis stabilization of a low earth orbit satellite. The problem of controlling the spacecraft attitude using only magnetic torquing is realized in the form of a infinite horizon periodic controller. BT - Optimal magnetic attitude control},
